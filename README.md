# Static-Website-Deployment-Using-Ansible-Playbook
Developed an Ansible playbook to automate the deployment of a static website. The playbook installs NGINX, starts the NGINX service, and deploys the website content to the server. Implemented as part of infrastructure automation for efficient and scalable website deployment.
